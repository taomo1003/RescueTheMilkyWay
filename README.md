# RescueTheMilkyWay
This is the final project from Virtual Reality Class. This model could build and render a space system in Unity using C# with coordinates and other information. Simple demo game is presented (named Rescue the Milky Way). 

There are some issue with video in IOS.

Don't use this one.
